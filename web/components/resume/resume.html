          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>I am a passionate <time datetime="1989-12-24 00:00" title="December 24th, 1989">24-year-old</time> software engineer from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland" target="_blank">Finland</a> who enjoys spending time in the field of architectures, designs, security and programming.</p>
          <p>The web is my greatest passion, although I have written a fair amount of code for desktop and other type of software, too. I love designing architectures and writing code for larger web-based software.</p>
          <p>I am a self-taught person and being up-to-date, strengthen my skills and not live in a barrel play a big role in my everyday life. I have found programming to be a lifestyle rather than a career choice.</p>
          <p>My preferred programming languages include Dart, Scala, Rust, C#, ECMAScript (JavaScript). I use other languages too if they fit the problem. As for databases, having used many, I like PostgreSQL, HBase and Redis most.</p>

          <br />

          <h2>Work experience</h2>

          <h3>Founder</h3>
          <span class="company-name">Cindela, Inc.</span>
          <span class="experience-duration">January 2013 — Present</span>
          <x-collapsible readMoreText="Read more about this case" initialHeight="{{44}}">
            <p>In December 2012, I decided to quit my full-time job and founded a company to work as an independent contract-based professional. The primary motivation was to learn new and improve myself.</p>
            <p>I used Skype video calls for communication around the world in the English language, often ranging between 6-12 hours a day. Tools such as <a href="http://www.asana.com" target="_blank">Asana</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> have been in use as well.</p>
            <p>I have spent most of the time building complex web software using <a href="http://www.dartlang.org" target="_blank">Dart</a>, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. I became a top (rank #3 as of writing) contributor on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/dart/topusers" target="_blank">StackOverflow for Dart</a> with 125+ answers and I built a great reputation within the Dart community as an active "Dartisan".</p>
            <p>Throughout the year I built a few open source libraries for Dart such as a <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/DartZip" target="_blank">Zip implementation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/mailer" target="_blank">SMTP client</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/CRC32" target="_blank">CRC32</a>, a full-blown <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Animation" target="_blank">Animation</a> library with easing support and also contributed to other open source projects, most notably the Dart <a href="https://github.com/vadimtsushko/objectory/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">MongoDB database drivers</a>.</p>
            <p>GitHub's activity shows that I made 2700+ contributions in 2013. Most of these are private and thus I decided to put a screenshot here instead of a link. Most of the contributions are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(data_management)" target="_blank">commits</a>:</p>

              <blockquote>Finding and retaining great people is perhaps the most difficult and most important feat for any company, and this certainly has been true in my own experience. I, like most, seek exceptional skills and talent, but also honesty, integrity, timeliness, great communication, initiative and dedication. It's a tall order, especially considering the best of the best are in high demand, and particularly in our industry where there is already short supply.<br />
                <br />
                You surpassed all my hopes and expectations on every level. I couldn't ask for a better lead engineer and all around great person to work alongside as we began building the platform I've been working towards for a long time. I am truly grateful, both on a professional and personal level, for all the time and energy and honest dedication you have put forth.</blockquote>

          <h2>Open source projects</h2>
          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/ScalaGit" target="_blank">Scala Git</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Scala</span></h3>
          <p>A pure Scala implementation of the Git version control written from scratch. I love Git, I wanted to learn Scala and I wanted to build a library to show off <em>some</em> of my skills and here is the result.</p>
          <p>So far this library can do a number of things. It can parse Git repositories. It understands all five types of objects (blob, commit, note, tree, tag). It can manipulate repositories in many ways such as read and write branches, commits, trees and tags.</p>
          <p>It's still a work-in-progress. I need to further study before I can implement diffing, merging and synchronization.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Concurrency-concepts" target="_blank">Concurrency concepts</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Document</span></h3>
          <p>An old guide about concurrency, multi-threading and parallel programming concepts that I wrote, because I wanted to learn about concurrency and what is a better way to do so than to read, study and write. The article explains the differences between the concepts, their advantages and disadvantages in detail.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Mailer" target="_blank">Mailer</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
          <p>Compose and send emails from Dart. Supports both plaintext and HTML emails, has Unicode support, attachments, filters and sanitizes fields for security, allows you to use SMTP servers such as Gmail or <a href="http://sendgrid.com/" target="_blank">SendGrid</a>, supports SSL/TLS and offers pre-configured services like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/" target="_blank">Amazon SES</a>.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Git-GUI" target="_blank">Git GUI</a> <span class="title-small-print">— C#, .NET, WPF</span></h3>
          <p>I wanted to learn C# and especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation" target="_blank">WPF</a> along with its interesting parts such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UI_data_binding" target="_blank">data binding</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel" target="_blank">MVVM</a>, so I started Git-GUI, which is a powerful graphical user interface for Git that runs on Windows. It's a standalone product and requires no Git installation. It provides <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rSpv0R1tqYY/UwIZ__ul-pI/AAAAAAAAN3Q/s0TK8TKiVa4/s0/2014-02-17_16-17-37.png" target="_blank">a nice UI</a> to manage Git repositories.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/DartZip" target="_blank">Zip</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
          <p>A zip parser, reader and generator written in pure Dart. It is memory efficient; requires the minimum amount of memory to, for instance, extract specific files.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Animation" target="_blank">Animation</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
          <p>This library offers standard animation capabilities such as stopping and pausing animations, some pre-made effects, animation queues and a powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening" target="_blank">easing</a> engine that supports everything you need from linear animations to quadratic to sine.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Zlib" target="_blank">Zlib</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
          <p>On a rainy Saturday evening, I started a daunting task to write Zlib from scratch in Dart. Zlib is a data compression tool, which relies on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE" target="_blank">DEFLATE</a> compression algorithm (a variant of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77" target="_blank">Lempel-Ziv 1977</a>). I never really intended it to be used for anything, but I wanted to learn and know how it all works. As of now, the deflation works 95% and inflation works 100%.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/ChiSquare" target="_blank">ChiSquare</a> <span class="title-small-print">— JavaScript</span></h3>
          <p>Calculates a Chi-square distribution over a sequence of bytes within a Buffer. The result is a floating point representing the probability of how frequently a truly random sequence of bytes would exceed the calculated value.</p>

          <p>An entropy calculator. Given data, it calculates the entropy and returns the amount of bits of entropy per byte.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Gomoku" target="_blank">Gomoku</a> <span class="title-small-print">— JavaScript</span></h3>
          <p>Like Tic-Tac-Toe, but 5 in-a-row to win. This game also has an AI based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank">Minimax</a> algorithm and is hard to beat.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Cinvasion" target="_blank">Cinvasion</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
          <p>Color Invasion (or Cinvasion) is a game where you fight to capture as much of the game area as possible. It also features a smart AI.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/CRC32" target="_blank">CRC32</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
          <p>A cyclic redundancy check calculator written in pure Dart.</p>
