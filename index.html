            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a passionate <time datetime="1989-12-24 00:00" title="December 24th, 1989">25-year-old</time> software engineer from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland" target="_blank">Finland</a> who enjoys spending time in the field of architectures, designs, security and programming.</p>
            <p>The web is my greatest passion, although I have written a fair amount of code for desktop and other types of software, as well. I love designing architectures and writing code for larger web-based software.</p>
            <p>I am self-educated, and keeping up to date and strengthening my skills play a big role in my everyday life. I have found programming to be a lifestyle rather than a career choice.</p>
            <p>My preferred programming languages include Rust, Scala, Dart, C#, ECMAScript (JavaScript). I use other languages as well if they fit the problem. As for databases, having used many, I like PostgreSQL, HBase and Redis the most.</p>
            <p>During my free time, I enjoy running, occasional swimming, playing strategy games and watching sci-fi &amp; horror movies and also TV shows. My favorite sport is running, which I do throughout the year, even in -20 °C (-4 °F) temperature using <a href="https://plus.google.com/110819633135253847377/posts/8LSpZC7wvAU" target="_blank">a breath warmer</a>.</p>

            <br />

            <h2>Work experience</h2>

            <h3>Founder</h3>
            <span class="company-name">Cindela, Inc.</span>
            <span class="experience-duration">January 2013 — Present</span>
            <p>In December 2012, I decided to quit my full-time job and founded a company to work as an independent contract-based professional. My primary motivation was to learn new and improve myself.</p>
            <p>I used Skype video calls for communication around the world in English, often ranging between 6-12 hours a day. I also used other tools such as <a href="http://www.asana.com" target="_blank">Asana</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>I spent most of my time building complex web software using <a href="http://www.dartlang.org" target="_blank">Dart</a>, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. Utilizing this experience, I became a top (rank #3 as of writing) contributor on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/dart/topusers" target="_blank">StackOverflow for Dart</a> with 125+ answers and I built a great reputation within the Dart community as an active "Dartisan".</p>
            <p>Throughout the year I also built a few open source libraries for Dart such as a <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/DartZip" target="_blank">Zip implementation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/mailer" target="_blank">SMTP client</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/CRC32" target="_blank">CRC32</a>, a full-blown <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Animation" target="_blank">Animation</a> library with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening" target="_blank">inbetweening</a> support and also contributed to other open source projects, most notably the Dart <a href="https://github.com/vadimtsushko/objectory/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">MongoDB database drivers</a>.</p>
            <p>GitHub's activity shows that I made 2700+ contributions in 2013. Most of these are private and thus I decided to insert a screenshot here instead of a link. Most of the contributions are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(data_management)" target="_blank">commits</a>:</p>

            <h3>Senior Software Engineer</h3>
            <a class="sub-title" href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/233658?trk=prof-exp-company-name" target="_blank">Loiste</a>
            <span class="experience-duration">August 2011 — January 2013 (1 year 6 months)</span>
            <p>I worked on projects for <a href="http://outotec.com" target="_blank">Outotec</a> who provides solutions for sustainable use of earth's natural resources. I built numerous tools and products for them, ranging from sales tools to product management tools.</p>
            <p>The sales tools helped them to quickly produce sales quotations out of several criteria, saving them days of time.</p>
            <p>Some other tools that I built for Outotec helped them run their operations smoother in terms of communication and retrieving information for sales and statistic purposes.</p>

            <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
            <a class="sub-title" href="http://www.nordsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Nord Software Ltd.</a>
            <span class="experience-duration">April 2010 — June 2011 (1 year 3 months)</span>
            <p>I was part of a small team to produce <a href="https://eautokoulu.fi/" target="_blank">E-autokoulu</a>, an online driving school management software.</p>
            <p>Later on I worked on <a href="http://viia.hrhouse.fi" target="_blank">VIIA</a>, which is an online human resource management service.</p>

            <hr />

            <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
            <span class="sub-title">Armoured Brigade (Finnish Army)</span>
            <span class="experience-duration">September 2009 — April 2010 (8 months)</span>
            <!--<p>During my military service, which is obligatory in Finland for men, I applied for the position of a software engineer.</p>-->

            <h2>Open source projects</h2>
            <p>A list of some projects I have built in my spare time.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/ScalaGit" target="_blank">Scala Git</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Scala</span></h3>
            <p>A pure Scala implementation of the Git version control written from scratch. I love Git, I wanted to learn Scala and I wanted to build a library to show off <em>some</em> of my skills and here is the result.</p>
            <p>So far this library can do a number of things. It can parse Git repositories. It understands all five types of objects (blob, commit, note, tree, tag). It can manipulate repositories in many ways such as read and write branches, commits, trees and tags.</p>
            <p>It's still a work-in-progress. I need to study Git internals further before I can implement diffing, merging and synchronization.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Concurrency-concepts" target="_blank">Concurrency concepts</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Article</span></h3>
            <p>An old guide about concurrency, multi-threading and parallel programming concepts that I wrote because I wanted to learn about concurrency—and what would be a better way to do so than to read, study and write about it? The article explains the differences between the concepts and their advantages and disadvantages in detail.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Mailer" target="_blank">Mailer</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
            <p>With this mailer, you can compose and send emails from Dart. Supports both plain-text and HTML emails, has Unicode support, attachments, filters and sanitizes fields for security, allows you to use SMTP servers such as Gmail or <a href="http://sendgrid.com/" target="_blank">SendGrid</a>, supports SSL/TLS and offers pre-configured services like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/" target="_blank">Amazon SES</a>.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Git-GUI" target="_blank">Git GUI</a> <span class="title-small-print">— C#, .NET, WPF</span></h3>
            <p>I wanted to learn C# and especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation" target="_blank">WPF</a> along with some of its interesting parts, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UI_data_binding" target="_blank">data binding</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel" target="_blank">MVVM</a>. With these goals in mind, I started Git-GUI, which is a powerful graphical user interface for Git that runs on Windows. It's a standalone product and requires no Git installation. It provides <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rSpv0R1tqYY/UwIZ__ul-pI/AAAAAAAAN3Q/s0TK8TKiVa4/s0/2014-02-17_16-17-37.png" target="_blank">a nice UI</a> to manage Git repositories.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/DartZip" target="_blank">Zip</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
            <p>The Zip format implemented from scratch in Dart. It can parse, read and write Zip archives. It is memory efficient, requiring the minimum amount of memory to extract specific files, for instance.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Animation" target="_blank">Animation</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
            <p>This library offers standard animation capabilities such as stopping and delaying animations, some pre-made effects, animation queues and a powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening" target="_blank">inbetweening</a> engine that supports everything you need from linear animations to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation" target="_blank">quadratic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine" target="_blank">sine</a>.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Zlib" target="_blank">Zlib</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
            <p>On a rainy Saturday evening, I started a daunting task to write Zlib from scratch in Dart. Zlib is a data compression tool which relies on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE" target="_blank">DEFLATE</a> compression algorithm (a variant of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77" target="_blank">Lempel-Ziv 1977</a>). I never really intended it to be used for anything, but I wanted to learn and know how it all works. As of now, the deflation works 95% and the inflation works 100%.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/ChiSquare" target="_blank">ChiSquare</a> <span class="title-small-print">— JavaScript</span></h3>
            <p>Calculates a Chi-square distribution over a sequence of bytes within a Buffer. The result is a floating point representing the probability of how frequently a truly random sequence of bytes would exceed the calculated value.</p>
            <p>You can use this library to determine if your random data source produces good random data. There is a wide variety of ways to measure random data quality (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean" target="_blank">arithmetic mean</a>, <a href="http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/classes/SP09/COGS14/NOTES/entropy.pdf" target="_blank">entropy frequencies</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank">Monte Carlo simulations</a>, etc.), but among all of them, calculating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution" target="_blank">the chi square distribution</a> over the random data reveals much more.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Entropy" target="_blank">Entropy</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
            <p>An entropy calculator. Given data, it calculates the entropy and returns the amount of bits of entropy per byte.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Gomoku" target="_blank">Gomoku</a> <span class="title-small-print">— JavaScript</span></h3>
            <p>Like Tic-Tac-Toe, but 5-in-a-row to win. This game also has an AI based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank">Minimax</a> algorithm and is hard to beat.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/Cinvasion" target="_blank">Cinvasion</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
            <p>Color Invasion (or Cinvasion) is a game where you fight to capture as much of the game area as possible. It also features a smart AI.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/PHP-Security-Library" target="_blank">Security Library</a> <span class="title-small-print">— PHP</span></h3>
            <p>A very old security library for PHP. It provides advanced random data generation, encryption utilities as well as certificate generation and signing.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/CRC32" target="_blank">CRC32</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
            <p>A cyclic redundancy check calculator written in pure Dart.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/QueryString" target="_blank">QueryString</a> <span class="title-small-print">— Dart</span></h3>
            <p>Parsing and constructing query strings in Dart the easy way.</p>

            <br />

            <h2>Programming language skills</h2>

            <h3>JavaScript (ECMAScript) <span class="title-small-print">— Expert, 8 years of use</span></h3>
            <p>I have read the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/">ECMA-262 5.1 specification</a> and followed <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts" target="_blank">the ES 6 Harmony specs</a> quite closely. I have a bunch of JavaScript guru friends such as <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/raynos/" target="_blank">Jake Verbaten</a>, a NodeConf speaker, who would always recommend me.</p>
            <p>My JavaScript knowledge covers many areas such as <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>, <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/" target="_blank">ExtJS</a>, <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> and a little bit of <a href="http://phonegap.com/" target="_blank">PhoneGap</a>, as well. I understand many things from hoisting to the way the event loop works.</p>
            <p>I used to love pure JavaScript and I still quite like it, but sometimes it feels too clumsy. Nowadays I prefer <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/" target="_blank">Dart</a> over it, not just due to syntactic reasons, but also for semantic reasons.</p>

            <h3>Scala <span class="title-small-print">— Comfortable, 1½ years of <em>passionate</em> use</span></h3>
            <p>Lately I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/ScalaGit" target="_blank">Scala Git</a>, which is a complete rewrite of the Git version control in pure Scala. The more I learn and write Scala, the more I love it. I'd very much like to program Scala at work.</p>
            <p>My goal is to write pure functional code that embraces immutability and simplicity. I like that Scala's syntax is very flexible and thus allows you to write internal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language" target="_blank">DSL's</a>.</p>

            <h3>Rust <span class="title-small-print">— Comfortable, one year of active use</span></h3>
            <p>Rust is my current favorite language and I started learning it by writing <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/rust_git" target="_blank">rust_git</a>, but later I have worked more on <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/comp_sci.rs" target="_blank">comp_sci</a>.</p>

            <h3>Dart <span class="title-small-print">— Expert, 2 years of very active use</span></h3>
            <p>I have used Dart for work purposes for more than a year. I have also used it for hobby projects for 2 years and have learnt to write simple, efficient and beautiful code for both the client and server side.</p>
            <p>Larger single-page apps built on <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank">Polymer</a> entice me.</p>

            <h3>C# <span class="title-small-print">— Comfortable, 2 years of use</span></h3>
            <p>Although not my favorite language, I like it far more than Java and I've used it for work and hobby projects and I feel comfortable with it and the related technologies, such as .NET and WPF.</p>

            <h3>PHP <span class="title-small-print">— Expert, have used for too long</span></h3>
            <p>This is the first programming language I used to create dynamic websites and tools. I've used PHP at work and during my free time for a long time and I do not look towards using it anymore. I used to use tools such as Symfony, Yii and Composer.</p>

            <h3>Python, Java, GML, (Visual) Basic</h3>
            <p>I have used a range of languages that I no longer practice actively. In the past I have used Java, GML, Basic and VB.NET for various random purposes. A little for work, but mainly to satisfy my curiosity.</p>

            <h2>Other skills</h2>

            <h3>Human languages</h3>
            <p>English (fluent, good communicative skills), Finnish (mother tongue)</p>

            <h3>Git, Mercurial, Subversion</h3>
            <p>I have used each of these version control systems at work. I am definitely a Git guru, as I understand its internals better than most programmers. This is because I've been working on a <a href="https://github.com/kaisellgren/ScalaGit" target="_blank">Scala Git</a> implementation, in addition to years of actual use at work.</p>

            <h3>Photoshop</h3>
            <p>As a kid I made some website designs in Photoshop and sold them at <a href="https://www.digitalpoint.com/" target="_blank">Digital Point</a>. It's my standard tool for any work related to graphics. I am not a graphics designer, but I feel I have a better understanding of design than many other programmers. This resume, albeit simple (as intended), was designed in Photoshop.</p>

            <h3>MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, HBase, Memcached</h3>
            <p>I have actual work experience with both relational and non-relational databases. I am a big fan of PostgreSQL and Redis. I find MongoDB horrendous due to the extreme locking practice they use for concurrency. It's not well-suited for apps that write often.</p>

            <h3>Web development</h3>
            <p>I have a thorough knowledge of common technologies related to web development, such as HTML and CSS. I have done LESS, SASS, used HTML5 APIs and semantic tags, and played around with clever CSS3 transitions, animations and layouts with flexboxes. It's pointless to list all the things I've done or used, but I can say I like complex modern single-page web apps.</p>

            <h3>Regular expressions</h3>
            <p>Whether it's about lookarounds, atomic grouping or recursion, I know how to use regular expressions efficiently and I love them.</p>

            <h3>Linux servers</h3>
            <p>I prefer Linux for server purposes and I know my way around it to get things done, such as setting up nginx to proxy WebSocket traffic, deploying web apps or using a CDN to serve content. I also have a bit of experience with AWS.</p>

            <h3>Payment systems</h3>
            <p>I have dealt with a number of payment systems such as PayPal, Verkkomaksut and AlertPay.</p>
